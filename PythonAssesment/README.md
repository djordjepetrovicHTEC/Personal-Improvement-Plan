## Task: Python Objects and Data Structures
### subtask 1: Creating and Manipulating Lists
>Create an empty list called my_list.
>Append the integers 1, 2, and 3 to my_list.
>Add the string "hello" to my_list.
>Print my_list.
>Remove the integer 2 from my_list.
>Print the length of my_list.
>Print the first element of my_list.
### Subtask 2: Working with Dictionaries
>Create an empty dictionary called my_dict.
>Add the key-value pair 'name': 'John' to my_dict.
>Add the key-value pair 'age': 25 to my_dict.
>Print my_dict.
>Update the value of the 'age' key to 30.
>Print all the keys in my_dict.
>Print all the values in my_dict.
### Subtask 3: Understanding Sets
>Create a set called my_set containing the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
>Add the integer 5 to my_set.
>Remove the integer 3 from my_set.
>Print my_set.
>Create another set called other_set containing the integers 3, 4, 5, and 6.
>Find the intersection of my_set and other_set.
>Find the union of my_set and other_set.
### Subtask 4: Exploring Tuples
>Create a tuple called my_tuple containing the strings "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
>Print the second element of my_tuple.
>Attempt to change the first element of my_tuple to "orange" and observe the result.
>Print the length of my_tuple.
>Concatenate my_tuple with another tuple containing the strings "date" and "elderberry".
>Print the result of the concatenation.
### Subtask 5: Learning about Strings
>Create a string variable called my_string containing any sentence of your choice.
>Print the length of my_string.
>Print the first three characters of my_string.
>Print the last three characters of my_string.
>Check if the word "Python" is present in my_string.
>Replace any whitespace in my_string with underscores.
>Convert my_string to uppercase and print the result.
### Subtask 6: Creating Custom Classes
>Create a class called Car with attributes make, model, and year.
>Write a method within the class called display_info that prints out the car's make, model, and year.
>Create an instance of the Car class with the make "Toyota", model "Camry", and year 2020.
>Call the display_info method on the instance to display the car's information.
## Bonus:
>Implement error handling for user input, such as ensuring the correct data type is entered for certain tasks.
>Encapsulate the subtasks into separate functions for better organization and reusability
