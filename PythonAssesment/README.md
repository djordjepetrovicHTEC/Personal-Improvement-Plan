## Task: Python Objects and Data Structures
### subtask 1: Creating and Manipulating Lists
>Create an empty list called my_list. <br>
>Append the integers 1, 2, and 3 to my_list. <br>
>Add the string "hello" to my_list. <br>
>Print my_list. <br>
>Remove the integer 2 from my_list. <br>
>Print the length of my_list. <br>
>Print the first element of my_list. <br>
### Subtask 2: Working with Dictionaries
>Create an empty dictionary called my_dict. <br>
>Add the key-value pair 'name': 'John' to my_dict. <br>
>Add the key-value pair 'age': 25 to my_dict. <br>
>Print my_dict. <br>
>Update the value of the 'age' key to 30. <br>
>Print all the keys in my_dict. <br>
>Print all the values in my_dict. <br>
### Subtask 3: Understanding Sets
>Create a set called my_set containing the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. <br>
>Add the integer 5 to my_set. <br>
>Remove the integer 3 from my_set. <br>
>Print my_set. <br>
>Create another set called other_set containing the integers 3, 4, 5, and 6. <br>
>Find the intersection of my_set and other_set. <br>
>Find the union of my_set and other_set. <br>
### Subtask 4: Exploring Tuples
>Create a tuple called my_tuple containing the strings "apple", "banana", and "cherry". <br>
>Print the second element of my_tuple. <br>
>Attempt to change the first element of my_tuple to "orange" and observe the result. <br>
>Print the length of my_tuple. <br>
>Concatenate my_tuple with another tuple containing the strings "date" and "elderberry". <br>
>Print the result of the concatenation. <br>
### Subtask 5: Learning about Strings
>Create a string variable called my_string containing any sentence of your choice. <br>
>Print the length of my_string. <br>
>Print the first three characters of my_string. <br>
>Print the last three characters of my_string. <br>
>Check if the word "Python" is present in my_string. <br>
>Replace any whitespace in my_string with underscores. <br>
>Convert my_string to uppercase and print the result. <br>
### Subtask 6: Creating Custom Classes
>Create a class called Car with attributes make, model, and year. <br>
>Write a method within the class called display_info that prints out the car's make, model, and year. <br>
>Create an instance of the Car class with the make "Toyota", model "Camry", and year 2020. <br>
>Call the display_info method on the instance to display the car's information. <br>
## Bonus:
>Implement error handling for user input, such as ensuring the correct data type is entered for certain tasks. <br>
>Encapsulate the subtasks into separate functions for better organization and reusability. <br>
