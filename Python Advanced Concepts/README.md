## Task: Python Advanced Concepts
### subtask 1: Error/Exception Handling
>Create a function called divide_numbers that takes two integers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second. <br>
>Handle the ZeroDivisionError exception by displaying a message to the user if the second number is zero. <br>
>Handle the ValueError exception by displaying a message to the user if non-integer input is provided. <br>
### Subtask 2: Using Decorators
>Create a decorator function called debug that prints the name of the function being called and its arguments. <br>
>Apply the debug decorator to the divide_numbers function. <br>
>Test the decorated divide_numbers function with various inputs and observe the debug output. <br>
### Subtask 3: Working with Generators
>Create a generator function called generate_fibonacci that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit. <br>
>Use the generate_fibonacci generator to print the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th number. <br>
>Write a generator expression that generates the squares of numbers from 1 to 5. <br>
>Use a loop to print the squares generated by the generator expression. <br>
### Subtask 4: Exception Handling in Generators
>Modify the generate_fibonacci generator to handle a ValueError if the limit provided is not a positive integer. <br>
>Test the modified generate_fibonacci generator with various input types to ensure proper error handling. <br>
### Subtask 5: Combining Concepts
>Create a function called safe_divide_fibonacci that takes two integers as input, divides them, and generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the quotient. <br>
>Apply the debug decorator to the safe_divide_fibonacci function. <br>
>Test the safe_divide_fibonacci function with different inputs, ensuring proper error handling and debug output. <br>
## Bonus:
>Implement additional error handling for invalid input types in the safe_divide_fibonacci function <br>
